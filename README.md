### **General Guidelines**

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1.  The first weeks will be used for intensive self learning.
    Each topic will have reading and practices parts.
    Tutors will be available to answer technical questions.

2.  Another week will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3.  It is a plus, all the exercises should work within a mobile environment.

4.  Team play is encouraged but the work might be evaluated per person or group, depending on number of bootcamp students (ask your tutor).

5.  All code and documentation must be in English.

6.  Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

### **Learning Days**

Each stage you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps: yeah, web apps! Web apps powered by the latest, and coolest toolkits, and techniques.

On each learning stage you will have to:

1.  **Read:** We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2.  **Practice:** You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
    Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each stage and they should get most of your attention.
    If you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3.  **Commit:** You will commit all your code as soon as you finish each exercise. If not you must commit your work in a daily basis.

#### **Introduction**

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/html5-css-javascript.png "The platform")

HTML describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications.

Now that you know which are the three pilars of a web application's UI, it's time to dive into them.

**Practice**

*Latest IE, Chrome and Firefox browser should be used. All exercises must be done with ECMAScript 6 syntax.*

1.  Creating our index page with some sections.

    *   Create a file called `index.html` with the correct doctype and some random content.

    *   Add a stylesheet to the HTML file and use it to center the texts of all `section` elements.

    *   Add a hidden `section` with `Hello World` inside of it.

    *   When the page finished loading the section must fade in.

2.  Adding some events

    *   Add a button below the `section` to your index page.

    *   Create a function that showcases an alert message when called.

    *   Attach a click event to the created button which calls the function previously created.


3.  Data fetching

    *   Create a function to get the response from [http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random).

    *   Replace the button's click event with this new function.

    *   Write the response inside the `section` element.

    *   Create a reusable function to perform AJAX calls. This function must accept a `config` object and return an ES6 [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises).

    *   If a server error occurs `section` content must turn red.

    *   **Hint:** Use the XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from the service.

4.  Data fetching with parameters

    *   Create a function to get the response from [https://api.github.com/search/repositories](https://api.github.com/search/repositories) with parameters `q = 'JavaScript'`.

    *   Showcase a list of repositories, provided by the service, in the right side of the screen.

    *   **Hint:** `ul` must be used to list the repositories.

    *   Add an input with `type="text"` to perform a search for any value.

5.  W3C

    *   Validate your page using W3C validator: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/)

6.  DOM manipulation

    *   Write a function that takes as input a matrix of data and outputs a DOM structure representing a table. Attach it to the body of a given page.

    *   **Hint:** use `document.createElement`, `document.createTextNode`, and `Node.appendChild` methods.

<h4 id="topic2">Topic 2 - Design Patterns and OOP in JavaScript</h4>

In this Topic we will focus on learning how JavaScript approaches Object-Oriented programming.

If you come from Java, or .NET you will find yourself a little bit lost at the beggining.
ECMAScript6 provides a layer of syntactic sugar over the previous version (5.1) that is expected to simplify the language.

**Reading**

1. Understand how *prototypes* works in ECMAScript 5.1 [http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/](http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/)

2. ECMAScript 6 New Features: [http://es6-features.org/](http://es6-features.org/). You can compare ECMAScript 5 and 6 code.

3. Read the Chapter on JavaScript classes from [*Understanding ECMAScript6*](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-classes)

4. Read about [ES6 Modules](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-modules-in-depth)

5. Extra: Read about AMD, CommonJS, and ES6 Modules [Writing Modular JavaScript](https://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-modular-javascript/)

6. An overview on all the features ECMAScript provides [https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)

**Practice**

1.  Creating classes

    *   Create a Movie Class with the following structure

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Movie</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    - title <br />
                    - year <br />
                    - duration
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    + constructor(name, year, duration) <br />
                    + play() <br />
                    + pause()<br />
                    + resume()
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    *   Instantiate some of your favorite movies and play with them in the console.

    *   Create an Actor class with the following structure

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Actor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    - name <br />
                    - age
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    + constructor(name, age)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    *   Create a class called EventEmitter with the following structure

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>EventEmitter</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    + constructor()<br />
                    + on(eventName, callback) <br />
                    + emit(eventName)<br />
                    + off(eventName, callback)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        The `on` method will receive a eventName and a callback or **listener** that will be executed each time a that event is triggered.

        The `emit` method will trigger events to be consumed by other functions or objects.

        The `off` method will delete previously defined event listeners.

2.  Class inheritance

    *   Make the Movie class a subclass of [EventEmitter](https://netbasal.com/javascript-the-magic-behind-event-emitter-cce3abcbcef9) and use the inherited methods to publish `play`, `pause` and `resume` events when the related method is called.

3.  Working with classes

    *   Add a method to Movie as `addCast(cast)` that allows the addition of one or more Actors to a movie. It must work if provided with more than one Actor at the same time.

        You should be able to do something like

        ```js
        const terminator = new Movie('Terminator I', 1985, 60);
        const arnold = new Actor('Arnold Schwarzenegger', 50);
        const actors = [
            new Actor('Paul Winfield', 50),
            new Actor('Michael Biehn', 50),
            new Actor('Linda Hamilton', 50)
        ];

        terminator.addCast(arnold);
        terminator.addCast(otherCast);
        ```

    *   Create a Logger class with the following structure

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Logger</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    + constructor()<br />
                    + log(info)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        After creating this class make an instance of Logger and make it listen to Movie's `play` event.

        As example you must end with something like

        ```js
        const terminator = new Movie('Terminator I', 1985, 60);

        ...

        terminator.play(); // output: The 'play' event has been emitted
        ```

4.  Mixins

    *   Create an object called social, defining the methods `share(friendName)` and `like(friendName)` that generates the following output `{friendName} likes/share {movieName}`.

        Then extend a movie with it to have access to this methods.

        You should end with something like

        ```js
        const ironman = new Movie(...);

        ...

        ironman.share('Mike Blossom');
        ```

        **Hint:** A mixin is not a class which will be instantiated later on. Use a way to extend some object methods into another object. Template literals might be useful to generate the required output.

5.  ES6 Modules

    *   Split all your classes into different files.

    *   Using babel create a single JS bundle.

    **Hint:** check out [this](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/)

4.  SVG

    *   Create a web page with a SVG element to show a vector graphic.
        Make sure you understand when is better to use SVG instead of bitmaps, and viceversa.


5.  Canvas

    *   Create a web page with a canvas element. Upon page load draw basic geometric figures with random colors and strokes.

    *   Using the Canvas API, animate a rectangle's position on the screen. Make sure not to use setTimeout but setInterval to perform the animation.
